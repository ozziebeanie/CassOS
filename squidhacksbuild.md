This is the info for the SquidHacks build of KassOS. Me and my team are building a version of KassOS that is supported on single board computers, 
Like a raspberry pi, BBC micro:bit or arduino. With his will come a wave of new commands, such as SYSTEM and TOP. TOP will be the Text Based Task Manager,
and SYSTEM will tell you system info. We aim for the firlst build to be launched on the 10TH May, 2023. However, this may be delayed as we only have
a BBC micro:bit to test with. The raspberry pi blew up during the "I'm a real breadboard" project with my team. The USB ports stoped responding. We 
re-flashed it, but that killed Bread Pi. I don't know where the Bread Pi is now. Its gone. So expect credits to the Bread Pi in our version of KassOS.

Thnaks for reading about the Bread Pi and our version of KassOS

RIP Bread Pi
2017 - 2023
